Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we’ll “pull” the white half of the candy cane. Then we’ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it’s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you’ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon’t let the candy get too hard. When it’s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes.

Check them!\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are still hot peel and pass them through a food mill or ricer. (I find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nWhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\nCrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nForm the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!!\r\n\r\nUse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Deglaze with the porcini soaking liquid and cook until completely reduced. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, remaining 1/4 cup parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nTo assemble: Ladle some of the tomato sauce into the bottom of a 10 by 14 by 2 1/2-inch baking dish. Ladle some of the cauliflower mornay sauce over the tomato sauce. Top with 4 noodles. Top the noodles with some of the ricotta mixture, then some mushrooms, fontina, and romano. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat to make 4 layers. Ladle the cauliflower mornay sauce over the top of the noodles, making sure to cover the noodles completely with the sauce, and sprinkle with more of the romano cheese. Put the lasagna pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the top with parsley, and let rest 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve additional tomato sauce on the side.\r\n\r\nRecipe courtesy of Bobby Flay\r\n\r\nRead more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/wild-mushroom-and-cauliflower-lasagna-recipe.html?oc=linkback", ["2 tablespoon olive oil", "1 small yellow onion, finely diced", "2 clove garlic, finely chopped", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "3 cup canned plum tomatoes, and their juices", "2 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped", "3 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Honey", "<hr>", "1 medium head cauliflower", "2 tablespoon olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/4 cup flour", "5 cup whole milk, heated, divided", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 cup romano cheese, grated", "<hr>", "1 pound part-skim ricotta cheese", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped, divided, plus more for garnish", "3 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped", "1/2 cup romano cheese, grated, plus more for finishing", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoon olive oil", "3 clove garlic, smashed", "1 1/2 pound assorted mushrooms (shiitake, portobello, cremini), coarsely chopped", "2 shallots, finely diced", "1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes", "16 lasagna noodles, cooked for 5 minutes in boiling salted water, drained and rinsed with cold water", "1 1/4 pound fontina cheese, coarsely grated"],

Mix together all of the tamagoyaki ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy.\r\n\r\n2. Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. Roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. Don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. It will still taste great! Leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Vegetables:\r\n\r\n1. Place veggies into a heat proof bowl with a large pinch of salt.\r\n\r\n2. Add just enough boiling water to cover. Let stand for 5 minutes or until carrots have softened slightly.\r\n\r\n3. Drain and cool before packing into bento.\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Rice:\r\n\r\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with sesame seeds or furikake.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat.

Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk at medium speed.\r\n2. As the mixture comes together add 10 ounces of the flour, along with the yeast and salt and continue whisking until combined.\r\n3. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with a dough hook. Add another 4 ounces of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. At this point the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nTO ASSEMBLE\r\n\r\n1. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F.

This should take 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your burner.\r\n\r\nRemove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, the bowl of a stand mixer, or the bucket of a bread machine (whatever you plan to knead the dough in).\r\n\r\n**To make the dough:** Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the cold milk, then the flour and remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl in the order listed; the heat from the tangzhong will help to warm the cold milk.\r\n\r\nMix — by hand, on low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, or in a bread machine set to the dough cycle — to bring the dough together. Next, knead the dough until it’s smooth, elastic, and tacky. This will take up to 15 minutes by hand, 10 to 12 minutes on medium-low speed of a mixer, or the length of the dough cycle in a bread machine.\r\n\r\nShape the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover.\r\n\r\nLet the dough rise until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 to 90 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen).\r\n\r\n**To make the filling:** While the dough is rising, put the melted butter into a medium bowl and add the remaining ingredients, stirring until the mixture is the texture of damp sand. Set aside.\r\n\r\nLightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper. \r\n\r\n**To assemble the rolls:** Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and press it into a 10” x 12” rectangle that’s about 1/2” thick. For evenly shaped rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with corners), rather than an oval. \r\n\r\nSprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1/2” strip along one long side. \r\n\r\nStarting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log.\r\n\r\nScore the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1/2” to 2” pieces; this will make large, saucer-sized cinnamon rolls — their generous size is part of their charm. Cut the dough at the score marks. Dental floss will give you the cleanest cut: pull off a long piece of floss, loop it underneath the log at the score mark, and pull the ends in opposite directions to cut the dough. Repeat until you've cut all of the rolls. If you don’t have dental floss, a bench knife or sharp knife will work. \r\n\r\nPlace the rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them so there’s at least 2” between each one and they’re 2” away from the edges of the pan; a 3-2-3 arrangement works well. To prevent them from unraveling while they rise and bake, tuck the ends of the spirals underneath the rolls so that they’re held in place.\r\n\r\nCover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let them rise for 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen). The rolls should be puffy and the dough shouldn’t bounce back immediately when gently pressed.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 minutes before you’re ready to bake, position a rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F.\r\n\r\nBake the rolls for 14 to 18 minutes, until they’re a light golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one roll reads 190°F. Bake for the lesser amount of time for extra-soft rolls, and the longer amount of time for rolls with a bit more color and slightly firmer texture.\r\n\r\nRemove the rolls from the oven, place the pan on a rack, and brush the hot rolls with 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) of the melted butter. Let the rolls cool for 10 to 15 minutes before icing.\r\n\r\n**To make the icing:** Combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) melted butter with the remaining icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing with a spatula until smooth. Milk makes a lovely frosting; using cream in place of milk creates an extra layer of richness, while substituting buttermilk adds subtle tang, a nice counterpoint to the icing's overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nIce the rolls and serve immediately. If you’re planning to serve the rolls later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature, tightly covered, until you’re ready to use it.\r\n\r\nStore completely cooled rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month.", ["1/2 cup whole milk", "24 g Unbleached Bread Flour", "<hr>", "2/3 cup whole milk", "300 g Unbleached Bread Flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 teaspoon instant yeast", "4 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened", "<hr>", "1 tablespoon butter, melted", "107 g light brown sugar, packed", "14 g Unbleached Bread Flour", "3 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/16 teaspoon salt", "<hr>", "1 1/2 tablespoon butter, melted, for brushing tops", "1 1/2 tablespoon butter, melted, for icing", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon salt", "170 g confectioners' sugar, sifted", "1 to 2 tablespoons milk, cream, or buttermilk; enough to thin to desired consistency"],
